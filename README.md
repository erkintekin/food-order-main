# food-order-main

There is... my new, my only one and my beautiful project that looks like a Burger King clone. It is a Redux-Saga project and this project has a payment method which is Stripe.
You have to login the system with your e-mail and password so you can choose whatever you want to eat!
Also, you can pay your order with Stripe (you know what is the card number) so fast and see what did you buy and your total payment is :)
